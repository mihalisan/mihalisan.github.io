I am an Assistant Professor at the [Computation-based Science and Technology Research Center](https://www.cyi.ac.cy/index.php/castorc/about-the-center/castorc-center-overview.html) at [The Cyprus Institute](https://www.cyi.ac.cy/). I obtained my MSc and PhD from the [Department of Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where I remained as a Research Associate and subsequently an Honorary Research Fellow.  I completed my undergraduate studies at the [Department of Informatics and Telecommunications](http://www.di.uoa.gr/eng) at [the University of Athens](http://en.uoa.gr/), Greece, and have also held faculty and Visiting Researcher positions at the [Department of Computing](http://www.gold.ac.uk/computing/) at [Goldsmiths, University of London](http://www.gold.ac.uk/), and the [Dept. of Computer Science](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/
), [Rutgers University](http://www.rutgers.edu/) respectively.

I am interested in developing machine learning (ML) algorithms that are robust, efficient, generalizable, and interpretable - often by learning representations that carry such properties in a deep learning (DL) context. 

I work in a wide range of applications, such as  computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), while I am particularly interested in inter-disciplinary applications, such as machine learning for climate monitoring and earth observation, health, and science.  

For more details, see my list of [publications](/publications/) and  [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R9x_bZ8AAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests are in Machine Learning and its applications, focusing on analysis and interpretation of multi-sensory high-dimensional data â€“ often conveyed via visual, auditory, social, and biomedical signals.  For more details, see my list of publications (Google Scholar). -->
