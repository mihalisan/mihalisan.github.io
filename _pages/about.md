I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ucy.ac.cy") at the [University of Cyprus](https://www.ucy.ac.cy). Previously, I was Associate Professor at the [Computation-based Science and Technology Research Center](https://www.cyi.ac.cy/index.php/castorc/about-the-center/castorc-center-overview.html) at [The Cyprus Institute](https://www.cyi.ac.cy/), and have also held faculty and Visiting Researcher positions at the [Department of Computing](http://www.gold.ac.uk/computing/) at [Goldsmiths, University of London](http://www.gold.ac.uk/), and the [Dept. of Computer Science](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/
), [Rutgers University](http://www.rutgers.edu/) respectively. 

I obtained my MSc and PhD from the [Department of Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where I remained as a Research Associate and subsequently an Honorary (Senior) Research Fellow.  I completed my undergraduate studies at the [Department of Informatics and Telecommunications](http://www.di.uoa.gr/eng) at [the University of Athens](http://en.uoa.gr/), Greece.

I am interested in developing machine learning (ML) algorithms that are robust, efficient, generalizable, and interpretable - often by learning representations that carry such properties in a deep learning (DL) context. 

I work in a wide range of applications, such as  computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), while I am particularly interested in inter-disciplinary applications, such as machine learning for climate monitoring and earth observation, health, and science.

My research interests are in Machine Learning and its applications, focusing on analysis and interpretation of multi-sensory high-dimensional data – often conveyed via visual, auditory, social, and biomedical signals.  For more details, see my list of publications (Google Scholar). -->
